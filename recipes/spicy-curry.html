        <h2>Very <strong>Spicy</strong> Curry</h2>
        <p>Nice and <strong>hot</strong> </p>

        This is the perfect weeknight curry â€” it's primarily comprised of ingredients you probably already have on hand: chicken, onions, garlic, pantry spices, heavy cream, and canned tomatoes. Not a spice lover? All good; while there are a lot of warm ground spices that season the dish, this curry isn't spicy at all.
